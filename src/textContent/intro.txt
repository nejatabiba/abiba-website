### -Hi, I’m Nejat Abiba-

##### a programmer, problem solver, and creative thinker with a passion for building tools that make life easier. Whether it’s developing apps to streamline my life or honing my skills in JavaScript, React, and Python, I love turning ideas into practical solutions. 

##### When I’m not coding, I’m exploring nature, gaming (Dota 2 and Dark Souls are favorites), or crafting homebrew worlds for my D&D campaigns. Guided by a methodical approach to problem-solving and inspired by my family, I strive to create meaningful work that improves lives. Welcome to my portfolio!
